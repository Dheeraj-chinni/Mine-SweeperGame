# Mine-SweeperGame
Respected Sir/Madam
Done Minesweeper game using js
It is a game in which we click on a cell and based on the number on it,we decide how many mines are there as its neighbours
and when we click on a mine->Game over So,iam revealing the content of all cells to indicate that game is over.
Implemented FloodFill algorithm to deal the cases of clicking on a cell with no neighbouring Mines.
We Can change the no of mines,no of cells in the code to have different grids with different number of mines.
Flags,Timer are not yet setted.
Copy and Save the Content and Name them Accordingly to Run the Game.
